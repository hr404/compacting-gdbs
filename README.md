===============

Python scripts to compact ESRI file and personal geodatabases.

Scripts were written in Python 2.7 and for use in ArcGIS 10.1 or newer.
Run each script seperately.

Creator is not responsible for corrupted files after script has completed.

Copy and paste the code into your favorite Python IDE (IDLE, PyScripter etc...) and follow the instructions that pop-up.  It's probably best to test on a small folder before running on an entire drive letter.
